Things this bot needs to do before a 'release' build.

Priority: Move bot config to a file in assets folder. Doing it by command line is dumb with the number of settings I'm doing/it's more convenient.

Low Priority: Clean up main. It looks alright, but could be better.
Low Priority: Clean up how bot responds to pings from users. Right now it'll probably just respond to every ping senty to everyone from anyone
              So it should check the ping is actually meant for it.
Low Priority: So there's this function strstr(char * haystack, char * needle). There are a whole bunch of places where using this function would
              be better than the for loops I've been using, so those instances need to be cleaned up. I can do it later, though.

Under Observation: Bot recognizes when it has;
		           Successfully joined a server
                   Successfully authenticated with a server.
                   Successfully joined a channel.
                   I'm not sure if my solution is air tight yet, but the current system seems to work.

Should cleanup the way parsing is done, should use functions and structs.
Might be beneficial to #define reused string templates, reduce clutter.
Allow multiple modes, chosen with command arguments.
Allow custom strings in a .txt file in the assets folder. That might be trickyish.
Cleaner recording of what comes from the server. (It's a mess right now)
Verbose mode, some people like that mess I guess?
Allow user to choose target channel OR
Let bot choose channel at random from the channel list. (maybe LIST command?)
Allow user to set bots name with command line argument (something like -n "botname")

Stretch goal: 
One: Let's do some motha fuckin machine learning. Ima make a chat bot.
Two: Implement "meowspeak". The bot should take input string from a user in a channel and parrot it in "meowspeak". Basically adding nyas and stuff.

Potentially impossible goal: Swear less. I'll give it a fuckin shot.
