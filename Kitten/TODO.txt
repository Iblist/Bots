Things this bot needs to do before a 'release' build.

Priority: Clean up main, shit's gonna get messy if you don't do that before implementing ping responses.
Priority: Get bot responding to pings from user.

Should cleanup the way parsing is done, should use functions and structs.
Might be beneficial to #define reused string templates, reduce clutter.
Allow multiple modes, chosen with command arguments.
Allow custom strings in a .txt file in the assets folder. That might be trickyish.
Cleaner recording of what comes from the server. (It's a mess right now)
Verbose mode, some people like that mess I guess?
Allow user to choose target channel OR
Let bot choose channel at random from the channel list. (maybe LIST command?)
Allow user to set bots name with command line argument (something like -n "botname")

Stretch goal: 
One: Let's do some motha fuckin machine learning. Ima make a chat bot.
Two: Implement "meowspeak". The bot should take input string from a user in a channel and parrot it in "meowspeak". Basically adding nyas and stuff.

Potentially impossible goal: Swear less. I'll give it a fuckin shot.
